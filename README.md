Hey!

This is my first ever game engine that I made using C# windows Forms.
It's not the best engine out there, but it's the best i've ever made so far.
The code is terrible, and maybe a bit messy.

I do not mind if you use this engine for any purpose, commercial or personal, if you intend to.
I would like people to add on to it and make it better, since I am not the greatest of engine developers.
